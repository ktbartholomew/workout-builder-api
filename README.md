# workout-builder-api

An API that allows users to create cycling workouts and export them for use in Zwift

The primary purpose of this project is for me to learn Golang, while solving typical web app problems. Since it's a learning project, I'm intentionally not using libraries to do things like routing or UUID generation. I'd rather have the exercise of doing it myself, regardless of whether it's the most perfect implementation.

## Building the application

```
go build
```

## Running the API Server

```
workout-builder-api --port 8080
```
